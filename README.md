# Geographic-information-system-for-analyzing-the-investment-attractiveness-of-territories
My masters project. 

During this work, a decision support system has been created. It is based on collected from open cartographic and legal sources. The system uses a pairwise comparison model of the alternatives ELECTRE of the second type, which performs a multi-criteria assessment of the typ.

I have gathered data about Volgograd componies, wich is valuable in tasks of data analys and business planning, because data contains info about physical geografic location of company and Tax index of that companies. 
All project made on Django platform
